# A Console Based Practice for C# Learners

This console based app is made I am learning **C#** through [w3schools](w3schools.com/cs)

## Setting up if you are using **VS CODE**

1. Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) select and download the latest SDK version compatible with your operating system.
2. Verify installation on your terminal by typing `dotnet --version`
3. Set up VS Code Extensions for C#.
4. Fork this repository and add this to your local machine. If you need guide for using git,
   you can see how to fork repos in the docs of github.
5. Run `dotnet run` on your terminal.

## Important notes

- Some lessons from w3schools might look different from my code because they use the older way.
- Comments are provided.
